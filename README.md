# Priority-Queue-ADT-implementations

This is the second assessed exercise (out of two) of ADSE2 course in term 2 of year 2 in Bsc Computing Science degree in the University of Glasgow that I have submitted on March 21st, 2022. This submission has received A4.

To see the original specification of the assessed exercise, please look at the pdf file named "AE2 - ADSE2 - originally provided".

For this assessed exercise, I have covered to parts which are:

    1. Implemented in Java the Priority Queue abstract data type (ADT) using two different data structures:
       Heap and the BST (binary search tree).
    
    2. Used a Priority Queue to implement an algorithm for a practical problem, without relying on any
       Java library classes for my code implementation.

I have done this by including:
    
    1. The zip archieve (named "AE2 - ADSE2 Chae-Ryeong(Chloe) Yeo")
       containing the Java sources of my implementations (which are
       MinPriorityQueueBST.java, MinPriorityQueueHeap.java, and TestQueue.java; and
    
    2. A short (3 pages) report describing what I have done in each part of the exercise.
